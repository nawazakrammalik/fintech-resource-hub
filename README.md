## Design Decisions

- **Native WordPress Functions**: Used register_post_type() and register_post_meta() instead of ACF for better performance and compatibility
- **Tailwind CSS**: Chosen for rapid development and consistent styling
- **JavaScript Filtering**: Implemented client-side filtering for better performance
- **URL Parameters**: Added support for shareable filtered views
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind's responsive classes

## Performance Considerations

- Client-side filtering reduces server load
- Efficient DOM manipulation with jQuery
- Minimal CSS footprint with Tailwind
- Clean, semantic HTML structure

## Future Improvements

Given more time, these are the key improvements I would prioritize:

1. **Enhanced Search & Filtering**
   - Implement Elasticsearch integration for faster, more relevant search results
   - Add multi-select filtering (e.g., selecting multiple topics or types)
   - Add sorting options (newest, most viewed, trending)
   This would significantly improve content discovery and user experience.

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement Redis caching for API responses to reduce database load
   - Add lazy loading for resource cards
   - Optimize API responses with selective field loading
   These changes would improve load times and handle higher traffic efficiently.

3. **Analytics Integration**
   - Add view/click tracking for resources
   - Implement a simple dashboard for content performance
   - Export functionality for analytics data
   This would help content teams make data-driven decisions about future resources.

4. **User Experience Refinements**
   - Replace "Load More" with infinite scroll
   - Add resource preview modals
   - Implement a "Save for Later" feature
   These improvements would make the interface more modern and user-friendly.

5. **Developer Experience**
   - Add comprehensive WordPress filters and actions
   - Create template override system for theme customization
   - Improve code documentation and add inline examples
   This would make the plugin more extensible and easier to customize.
